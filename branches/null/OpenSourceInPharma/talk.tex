\abstract{
  
  Open-Source statistical software (in particular the R statistical
  data analysis system) is becoming increasingly popular for the
  analysis of pharmaceutical data, particularly in support of
  "omics" technologies within discovery.  While it is relatively
  straightforward to employ open-source tools for non-regulated
  activities within discovery, software used in any regulated
  context must meet more rigorous requirements for documentation,
  training, software life-cycle management, and technical support.
  
  In this talk, we will focus on R, a full-featured open-source
  statistical software package.  We'll briefly outline the benefits
  it provides, as seen from the perspective of a discovery
  statistician, show some example areas in which it is currently
  being used, and then discuss the documentation, training, and
  support required for this class of use.
  
  Next we will discuss what is needed for organizations need to be
  comfortable with employing open-source statistical software for
  regulatory use within clinical, safety, or manufacturing. We will
  then talk about how well or poorly R meets these requirements,
  highlighting current lacks.
  
  Finally, we will discuss the current options for third-party
  commercial support for R, and evaluate how well these options meet
  the requirements for use of R within both regulated and
  non-regulated contexts.
