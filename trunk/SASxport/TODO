- Write replacements for SAS's REVERSE function, which corrects for
  differences in endianness, and cnxptieee function, which is used to
  convert from the IBM floating point representation to the IEEE
  representation.

- Write test routines for very large files, particulary very large
  files with columns contiaining almost all missing values.

- Test that created files are properly read by SAS, particulary when
  the SAS version and OS version are set to the default values I've
  provided.

- Check function for 64 bit versions of R.  I suspect that there may
  be variable size issues for some int fields for write.xport().
