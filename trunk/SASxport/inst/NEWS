Version 1.2.3 2008-02-29
------------------------

Bug fixes:

- Fix typo in manual page for write.xport() reported by Yinlai Meng.


Version 1.2.2 2007-11-09
------------------------

Bug fixes:

-  Apply patches to fix problems on 64 bit platforms, as sumitted by
   Brian Ripley.  


Version 1.2.1 2007-11-05
-------------------------

Other:

- Correct warning message due to extraneous ';' charcters after
  function closing braces.


Version 1.2.0 2007-11-01
-------------------------

New Features:

- SAS format and iformat information is now accessed via 'SASformat()'
  and 'SASiformat()' functions instead of 'formats' and 'iformat'.  The
  information accessed by these functions is now stored in attributes
  with the same name.  This avoids conflicts with the use of 'format'
  by chron objects.

- Copies of the code for foreign::read.xport and foreign::lookup.xport
  is now part of the SASxport package, permitting extension to these
  functions as needed, and removing the dependency on the foreign
  package. 

- Overflow of SASxport numeric format values, which have a smaller
  range than IEEE 754 numeric values now standard,  now generates NAN
  instead of 0.0.  


Bug Fixes:

- Fix for problem storing negative numbers.

- SAS format length and digit information is now properly captured 
  by read.xport().  This is supported by an improved version of
  lookup.xport(). 

- SAS format information was not being properly utilized when more 
  than one format was present.

- Improved handling of SAS date formats
 

Other:

- Test routines added to test handling of numeric values.


Version 1.1.1
-------------------------

-  Display support information at package startup


Version 1.1.0 - 
-------------------------

New Features:

- Add support for autogeneration of SAS FORMAT information as a PROC
  CONTENTS fmtin= dataset.   This enables R factors to be handled
  properly on the receiving system.
