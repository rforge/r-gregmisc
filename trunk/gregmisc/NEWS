--------------

- Bump version number to 1.11.0 to better reflect the production
  status of the package.

  executed directly via the $PACKAGE$/gregmisc/bin/xls2csv script.  On
  MS-Windows systems, use $PACKAGE$/gregmisc/bin/xls2csv.bat instead.

  packages from CRAN and Bioconductor is now provided in
  $PACKAGE$/gregmisc/tools/

  really neaded a minimum number of elements to work on.

- Add colorpanel function, which generates a smoothly varying band of
  colors over a three color range (lo, mid, high).
