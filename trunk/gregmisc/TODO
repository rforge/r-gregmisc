- Gregmisc is getting pretty big, so it should be set into a set of
  more topic-specific packages:

	gplots
	gmodels
	gtool
	gmisc

- Modify csv2xls.pl to accept a sheet name in place of a sheet number 
  (worksheets may not occupy sequential sheet numbers in the file, making
   it hard to pull the right one out by number.)
