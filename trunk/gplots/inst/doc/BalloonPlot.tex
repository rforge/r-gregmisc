\section*{Introduction}

Numeric data is often summarized using rectangular tables. While
these tables allow presentation of all of the relevant data, they do
not lend themselves to rapid discovery of important patterns. The
primary difficulty is that the visual impact of numeric values is
not proportional to the scale of the nubmers represented

We have developed a new graphical tool, the \code{balloonplot},
which augments the numeric values in tables with colored circles
with area proportional to the size of the corresponding table
entry. This visually highlights the prominent features of
data, while preserving the details conveyed by the numeric values
themselves.

In this article, we describe the balloonplot, as
implemented by the \code{balloonplot} function in the
\code{gplots} package, and describe the features of our
implemenation.


\section*{Function description}

The function \code{balloonplot} accepts a table or a triplet (x,
y, z) of vectors representing the layout and contents of a matrix or
table.  It then plots a graphical matrix, where each cell displays
the appropriate numeric value plus a colored circle whose size
reflects the relative magnitude of the corresponding component. The
\emph{area} of each circle is proportional to the frequency of
data. (The circles are scaled so that the circle for largest value
fills the available space in the cell.)

As a consequence, the largest values in the table are ``spotlighted''
by the biggest cicles, while the smaller values are displayed
with very small circles.  Of course, circles can only have positive
radius, so the radius of circles for cells with negative values are
set to zero.  (A warning is issued when this ``truncation'' occurs.)

Of course, when labels are present on the table or provided to the
function, the graphical table is appropriately labeled.  In
addition, options are provided to allow control of various visual features
of the plot:

\begin{itemize}
  \item rotation of the row and column headers
  \item balloon color (globally or individually) 
  \item balloon shape 
  \item number of displayed digits
  \item method of scaling the balloon (by area or by radius)
  \item amount of space provided for row and column headers
  \item amount of space reserved for row and column entries
  \item and the traditional graphics parameters (title, background. ..)
\end{itemize}

\section*{Example using the \code{Titanic} data set}

For illustration purposes, we use the \code{Titanic} data set from
the \code{datasets} package.  \code{Titanic} provides survival status
for passengers on the tragic maiden voyage of the ocean liner
``Titanic'', summarized according to economic status (class), sex, and
age.


%Using \code{balloonplot}, we display the number of people surviving
%the Titanic tragedy, - figure~\ref{figure:Surv.Pop} categorized by gender, age
%and class.  Total number of people on
%Titanic are displayed in figure~\ref{figure:Total.Pop}. Finally, the
%proportion of surviors is shown in figure~\ref{figure:Surv.Pop}.

Tabular representation of surviving population}
\end{figure}


Figure~\ref{figure:Surv.Pop.White} displays a graphical table
without balloons.  (This was created by calling balloonplot with
the balloon color set to match the background color.)  Note
that one must explicitly pay attention to the values in the cells in
order to see any pattern in the data.

Now, we redraw this same figure using light blue circles
(Figure~\ref{figure:Surv.Pop}.  This is accomplished using the code:

{\small
\begin{verbatim}
library(gplots)
data(Titanic)

surv.pop <- cbind(Titanic[,,Age="Child", 
                         survived="Yes"],
                  Titanic[,,Age="Adult", 
                         survived="Yes"])
colnames(surv.pop) <- c("Child-M", "Child-F",
                         "Adult-M", "Adult-F")
balloonplot(as.table(surv.pop), xlab="", 
            ylab="", main="")
title("BalloonPlot : Surviving passengers by
 gender and age")
mtext("(Area proportional to frequency)")
\end{verbatim}
 }

\begin{figure}
%\vspace*{.1in}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../figures/SurvivedPop.pdf}
\caption{\label{figure:Surv.Pop}
Balloon plot of survived population}
\end{figure}

It is now easy to see that adult females and adult male crew
members survived in large numbers. In order to investigate further,
let us examine the number of individuals belonging to each
category:

\vspace{-0.25in}

{\small
\begin{verbatim}
total.pop <- cbind(apply(Titanic[,,Age="Child",],
                         c(1,2), sum), 
                   apply(Titanic[,,Age="Adult",], 
                         c(1,2), sum))
colnames(total.pop) <- c("Child-M", "Child-F", 
                         "Adult-M", "Adult-F")
balloonplot(as.table(total.pop), xlab="",
            ylab="", main="")
title("BalloonPlot : Total passengers by
 gender and age")
mtext("(Area proportional to frequency)")
\end{verbatim}
 }


\begin{figure}
%\vspace*{.1in}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../figures/TotalPop.pdf}
\caption{\label{figure:Total.Pop}
Balloon plot of total population}
\end{figure}

Figure\ref{figure:Total.Pop} shows that the largest number of
individuals are adult male crew (862), followed by adult males in
3rd class (462).  Thus it is not surprising that a large number of
adult male crew members survived.  However, we now see that survival
among 3rd class adult males should have been high too...  So, let's
look at the fraction of passengers from each group who survived.

{\small
\begin{verbatim}

surv.prop <- as.table(surv.pop/total.pop)

surv.prop[is.na(surv.prop)] <- 0

balloonplot(as.table(surv.prop), xlab="",
            ylab="", main="")
title("BalloonPlot : Surviving passengers
 by gender and age")
mtext("(Area proportional to frequency)")
\end{verbatim}
}


\begin{figure}
%\vspace*{0.1in}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../figures/SurvivedProp.pdf}
\caption{\label{figure:Surv.Prop}
Balloon plot of proportion of people surviving}
\end{figure}

Figure\ref{figure:Surv.Prop} shows a diferent aspect of data. We can
now easily see from size of the circles that all the children in
$1^{st}$ and $2^{nd}$ class survived, as did most of the women in
$1^{st}$ and $2^{nd}$ class as well as female crew.  It is now clear
that there is something distinctly different about survival among
3rd class passengers: it is much lower than survival in any of the
other classes.

It turns out that there is a well known reason for this difference.
Passengers in 1st and 2nd class, as well as crew members, had an
easier time reaching the lifeboats.  Since there were too few
lifeboats for the number of passengers and crew, most women and
children among the first and second class passengers as well as
female crew found space in a lifeboat, while many of the later
arriving 3rd class women and children were too late: the lifeboats
had already been filled and had moved away from the quickly sinking
ship.

\section*{Conclusion}

Using the well worn Titanic data, we have shown how balloonplots
help to convey important aspects of tabular data, without obscuring
the exact numeric values. We hope that this new approach to
visualizing tabular data will assist other statiticians in more
effectively understanding and presenting tabular data

We wish to thank .... and ... for the discussion on R-news which
lead to the development of \code{balloonplot}.
