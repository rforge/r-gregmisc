
Windows
=======

On Windows, the perl based routines (read.xls, xls2sep, xls2csv, xls2tab, 
xls2tsv, sheetNames, sheetCount) will not work with the perl in Rtools
but will work with ActiveState perl.

If you have ActiveState installed and the pl extension is associated with it
(which the ActiveState installer associates automatically) then these 
routines will automatically locate ActiveState perl even if you omit the 
perl= argument.

Also ensure that the package was built with ActiveState Perl and not the perl
in Rtools.
