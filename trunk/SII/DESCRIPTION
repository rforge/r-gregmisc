Description: 
   This package calculates ANSI S3.5-1997 Speech Intelligibility Index
   (SII), which is a standard method for computing the intelligibility
   of speech from acoustical measurements of speech and noise. This
   package includes data frames corresponding to Tables 1 - 4 in the ANSI
   standard as well as a function utilizing these tables and
   user-provided hearing threshold and noise level measurements  to
   compute the SII score.  
   --
   The initial purpose of this package is to support use of SII as a
   standard measure of severity of presbycusis (age-related of hearing
   loss).  
   --
   Development of this package was funded by the Center for Bioscience
   Educationand Technology (CBET) of the Rochester Institute of
   Technology (RIT).
