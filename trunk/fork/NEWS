Version: 1.2.0 - 2007-03-22
===========================

  - Added new function handleSIGCLD/restoreSIGCLD for setting
    up/removing a SIGCLD handler so that fork'ed processes can safely be
    ignored without becoming zombies.  See ?handleSIGCLD for details.  

  - Added regression tests for SysV and BSD style signal handling that
    checks for zombie process creation & tests that signal("SIGCHLD","ignore")
    and/or handleSIGCLD() prevents zombie process creation.
