}
\arguments{
  \item{xls}{name of the Microsoft Excel file}
  \item{sheet}{number of sheet within the Excel file from which data are
    to be read}
  \item{verbose}{logical flag idicating whether details should be
    printed as the file is processed.}
  \item{...}{additional arguments to read.table. The defaults of
    read.csv are used.}
}
\value{
  a data frame
}
\details{
  This function works translating the named Microsoft Excel file into a
  temporary .csv file, using Greg Warnes' xls2csv perl script (installed
  as part of the gregmisc package).

  Note that, in the conversion to csv, strings will be quoted. This is a
  problem if you are trying to use the \code{comment.char} option of
  \code{read.table} since the first character of all lines (including
  comment lines) will be "\"" after conversion.
