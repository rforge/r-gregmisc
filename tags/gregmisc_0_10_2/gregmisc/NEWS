- Fixed bug in running() that arose when the called function
  really neaded a minimum number of elements to work on.

- Added several new features to running(), it can now allow sequences
  shorter than the requested width to be present at the front, the back,
  or on both sides of the full lenth sequences.  This allows one to
  align the data so that the window is before, after, or around the
  indexed point.

- Add enhancements to estimable() provided by Søren Højsgaard
  <sorenh@agrsci.dk>:

  The estimable function now
  1) also works on geese and gee objects and
  2) can test hypotheses af the forb L * beta = beta0 both as a
     single Wald test and row-wise for each row in L.

- Add colorpanel function, which generates a smoothly varying band of
  colors over a three color range (lo, mid, high).
